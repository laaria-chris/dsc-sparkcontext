PySpark uses the [Py4J](https://www.py4j.org/) library under the hood to accomplish this. \n","\n","This is relevant to your development process because:\n","\n","- Sometimes you will see error messages or warnings related to Java code.\n","- Many of the function and variable names follow Java naming conventions rather than Python. In particular, you will see many examples of `camelCase` names in places where you would expect `snake_case` Python names.\n","\n","The architecture including Py4J is something like this (from the [PySpark Internals wiki](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/SPARK/PySpark+Internals)):\n","\n","![Data Flow architecture diagram with Py4J](https://i.imgur.com/YlI8AqEl.png)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["The driver program launches parallel operations on executor Java Virtual Machines (JVMs). This can occur either locally on a single machine using multiple cores to create parallel processing or across a cluster of computers that are controlled by a master computer. When running locally, \"PySparkShell\" is the application name. The driver program contains the key instructions for the program and it determines how to best distribute datasets across the cluster and apply operations to those datasets.\n","\n","The key takeaways for SparkContext are listed below:\n","\n","- SparkContext is a client of Sparkâ€™s execution environment and it acts as the master of the Spark application \n","- SparkContext sets up internal services and establishes a connection to a Spark execution environment  \n","- The driver is the program that creates the SparkContext, connecting to a given Spark Master  \n","\n","After creation, SparkContext asks the master for some cores to use to do work. The master sets these cores aside and they are used to complete whatever operation they are assigned to do. You can visualize the setup in the figure below:\n","\n","<img src =\"https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/dsc-sparkcontext/raw/master/images/spark_master_workers.png\" width=\"280\">\n","\n","This image depicts the worker nodes at work.

In fact, in some (Py)Spark environments, there will already be an object in memory called `sc` as soon as the environment is loaded. Therefore unless you have a very specific reason for changing the name, you are strongly encouraged to use the name `sc` to represent the SparkContext.\n","\n","#### Parameters\n","\n","In theory you could simply call `SparkContext()` to create your SparkContext, but in practice you should specify values for two parameters: `master` and `appName`.\n","\n","The `master` parameter is the cluster URL to connect to. If you were using a full-fledged Cluster Manager this URL might be something like `\"mesos://host:5050\"` but we are just running a local cluster. Therefore we'll specify a `master` value of `\"local[*]\"`. The `*` means that we are telling Spark to run on all available cores of our machine.\n","\n","The `appName` parameter is just a label for the application. It's similar to a Python variable name -- just there to help you understand what the code is doing. You can put any string value you like.\n","\n","#### Codealong\n","\n","In the cell below, instantiate a variable `sc` using the `SparkContext` class, a `master` of `\"local[*]\"`, and an `appName` of `\"sc practice\"`.\n","\n","```python\n","# Instantiate sc\n","sc = SparkContext(\"local[*]\", \"sc practice\")\n","```"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":3,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"name":"stderr","output_type":"stream","text":["24/07/12 12:47:59 WARN Utils: Your hostname, laaria-HP-Pavilion-Gaming-Notebook resolves to a loopback address: 127.0.1.1; using 192.168.1.10 instead (on interface wlo1)\n","24/07/12 12:47:59 WARN Utils: Set SPARK_LOCAL_IP if you need to bind to another address\n","Setting default log level to \"WARN\".\n","To adjust logging level use sc.setLogLevel(newLevel).
